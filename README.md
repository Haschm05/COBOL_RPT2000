# Cobol-RTP2000

## Introduction
This COBOL program calculates the amount changed for a customers sales from the previous year compared to the present year. It then subsequently calculates the percentage change as well.
The program then outputs the following information in a report:
  1. The Branch Number
  2. The Sales Rep Number
  3. The Customer Number
  4. The Customer Name
  5. Sales Figure This Year
  6. Sales Figure Last Year
  7. Change in Amount
  8. Change in Percetage

## What does it do?
  For each run, the program will:
  - 1. Calculates the sales difference between this year and the last year.
